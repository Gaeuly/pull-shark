## Project Description üìù

This project serves as a practical example and learning resource for understanding and implementing pull request workflows in a software development environment. While seemingly simple on the surface, the "pull-request" repository provides a foundational understanding of collaborative coding, version control, and code review processes, which are essential for effective team-based software development. This repository can be utilized in workshops, training sessions, or as a personal sandbox for experimenting with Git and GitHub functionalities.

The intention behind this project is to demystify the pull request process. Many new developers struggle to grasp the intricacies of branching, committing changes, creating pull requests, and merging code effectively. This repository provides a minimal yet functional example to walk through these steps without the complexity of a large codebase. By engaging with this project, users gain hands-on experience in creating feature branches, making focused commits, proposing changes through pull requests, and receiving constructive feedback from peers.

This project is particularly useful for:

*   **Junior developers** who are new to collaborative coding and version control.
*   **Teams** looking to standardize their pull request workflow.
*   **Instructors** who need a simple example to teach Git and GitHub concepts.
*   **Anyone** interested in practicing their code review skills.

## Key Features ‚ú®

*   **Basic JavaScript Functionality:** Implements a simple JavaScript function (see `index.js`) to provide a concrete example for code changes and pull requests.
*   **Clear Branching Strategy:** Demonstrates the use of feature branches for isolating code changes. This is a key practice in collaborative development, ensuring that main branches remain stable and deployable.
*   **Pull Request Workflow Example:** Provides a complete example of creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests. This allows users to experience the end-to-end process and understand the roles of different stakeholders.
*   **Configured with `package.json`:** Includes a `package.json` file, which makes it easier to manage dependencies and run simple scripts, further demonstrating best practices.
*   **Well-Documented:** This README serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the repository, ensuring that users can quickly get started and learn from the example.

## Installation & Running Locally üöÄ

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Node.js (version 12 or higher) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaeuly/pull-request.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pull-request
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or using yarn

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

5.  **Run the `index.js` file (optional):**

    You can execute the JavaScript file using Node.js.  This is optional as the primary focus is on the pull request workflow.

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

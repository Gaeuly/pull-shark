## Project Description üìù

This project, `script-github`, is a JavaScript-based tool designed to automatically assess and award GitHub achievements, specifically the "Pull Shark" and "Pair Extraordinaire" badges, based on predefined criteria. This script aims to streamline the often manual and subjective process of identifying contributors who deserve recognition for their exceptional contributions in these areas.  It's intended to provide a more data-driven and objective way to reward valuable contributions.

The "Pull Shark" achievement, typically awarded for consistently submitting high-quality and impactful pull requests, is evaluated by analyzing factors such as code quality, complexity, test coverage, and impact on the overall project. The script automates this analysis, saving valuable time for project maintainers and ensuring that deserving contributors are promptly recognized.

The "Pair Extraordinaire" achievement, recognizing exceptional collaboration and teamwork in pair programming scenarios, is assessed by analyzing commit logs, code reviews, and collaboration patterns. The script identifies instances where developers have demonstrably worked together to produce high-quality code, highlighting individuals who excel in collaborative coding environments.

This project is particularly useful for open-source projects, development teams, and organizations that want to foster a culture of recognition and reward exceptional contributions. By automating the achievement awarding process, `script-github` helps to boost morale, encourage collaboration, and improve the overall quality of the codebase.

## Key Features ‚ú®

*   **Automated Pull Shark Assessment:** Automatically evaluates pull requests based on predefined criteria to identify deserving contributors for the "Pull Shark" achievement. This saves time and ensures consistency in awarding the badge.
*   **Automated Pair Extraordinaire Assessment:** Identifies and recognizes developers who demonstrate exceptional collaboration and teamwork through pair programming. This fosters a collaborative development environment.
*   **Configurable Criteria:** The script's assessment criteria can be customized via the `config.json` file to align with specific project requirements and organizational goals.
*   **Data-Driven Recognition:** Provides a more objective and data-driven approach to awarding achievements, reducing bias and ensuring fairness.
*   **Easy Integration:** Can be easily integrated into existing GitHub workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

## Tech Stack & Tools üõ†Ô∏è

| Category | Technology/Tool | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Language | JavaScript | The primary programming language used for the script. |
| Runtime Environment | Node.js |  JavaScript runtime environment for executing the script. |
| Package Manager | npm | Used for managing project dependencies. |
| Configuration | JSON | Used for storing and managing configuration settings in `config.json`. |

## Installation & Running Locally üöÄ

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
    *   npm (Node Package Manager) installed. This usually comes with Node.js.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaeuly/script-github.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd script-github
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Configuration:**
    *   Examine the `config.json` file and adjust the settings to match your requirements.  This file likely contains settings related to GitHub authentication, the evaluation criteria for "Pull Shark" and "Pair Extraordinaire", and other operational parameters.
    * Ensure that the GitHub authentication details are accurate to avoid errors during execution.

6.  **Running the Script:**

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    This command will execute the main script file (`index.js`), which will then perform the analysis based on your `config.json` settings. The output will depend on the implemented logic of the script and the data it is processing. You might see messages printed to the console, updated data files, or even API calls made to GitHub.
